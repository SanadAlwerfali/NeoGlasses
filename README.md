# NeoGlasses - Capstone Project 

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to use technology to develop a solution that can provide assistance to the visually impaired. As technology advances, there is still a notable need for substantial efforts in creating an intuitive and cost-effective solution to aid individuals with navigation challenges. As a team, we realize the difficulty of developing an all-in-one solution that addresses all the problems visually impaired individuals face. However, even if the solution addresses a subset of these problems, the solution is recognized as a success.
